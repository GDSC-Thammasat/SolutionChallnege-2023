                    <p> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myofascial pain syndrome is a chronic pain disorder, whereby pressure on sensitive points in your muscles (trigger points) causes pain in the muscle and sometimes in seemingly unrelated parts of your body. This is called referred pain.

                <h2> What causes myofascial pain syndrome? </h2>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myofascial pain syndrome is caused by repetitive muscle work. This can be due to repetitive motions used in jobs or hobbies, or by stress-related muscle tension.  For example, sitting in front of the computer or tilting your head forward to text with the mobile phone, are repetitive works commonly seen nowadays.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the muscle becomes injured by repetitive contractions, trigger points develop. Trigger points are palpable nodules within the tight muscle; it can be at the center of muscle belly or at the end plates.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trigger points creates muscle tenderness and referred pain.  For example trigger points in the upper trapezius muscle, a muscle in shoulder regions, could trigger pain in neck and head.  This is one of the most common muscles involved in myofascial pain syndrome in office workers who spend all day sitting in front of computer, leaning forwards with curved shoulders.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trigger point treatment which can resolve myofascial pain include trigger point injection, muscle stretching, posture correction and aerobic exercises.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muscle tenderness and referred pain.  The pain can range from a dull ache to a shooting, sharp pain.  It can occur in any area of the body but is most commonly around the head, shoulder and back region. If not treated properly, the pain can become chronic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from pain, some patients report dizziness especially when turning their head from side to side.  This is an autonomic phenomenon that occurs with trigger points in sternocleidomastoid muscle.  This specific muscle functions as a neck flexor, and is therefore one of the common muscles involved in office workers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common autonomic phenomenon is sensory disturbance.  Some patients report numbness, goose bumps or hyperesthesia in their arms or neck.  These symptoms may cause patients to be anxious and fearful, due to the similarity to other life threatening disease such as stroke.  Neurologist consultation is often involved.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes myofascial pain syndrome can be secondary to abnormal anatomy of the body, for example spinal scoliosis, herniated discs, or spine degeneration.  Some of these diseases should not be left untreated and doctor consultation is mandatory.

                <h2> Who is at risk of myofascial pain syndrome? </h2>
                <p>
                    
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myofascial pain syndrome can occur to anyone.  However, those with higher risk of the syndrome are people who perform repetitive works, such as office workers. Similarly, sport injuries from inappropriate posture can also result in myofascial pain syndrome.
                </p>
                <p>
                        <h4>Below is a list of some of those at risk of myofascial pain syndrome:</h4>
                    <ol type='disc'>
                        <li className='knowledge'>Hunching over a smartphone or computer for more than 6 hours a day</li>

                <h2> Myofascial pain treatment </h2>  

                <h4>Acute treatment</h4>
                <p>   
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trigger point injection and dry needling can relieve the pain effectively and immediately.  Trigger point injections are performed by inserting a small needle into the patientâ€™s trigger point. The injection contains a local anesthetic or saline, and may include a corticosteroid. Following the injection, the trigger point is made inactive and the pain is alleviated. Several sites may be injected in one visit.  The dry-needle technique whereby no medicine used is also an effective alternative. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Massage and physical therapy is another effective remedy for myofascial pain.  Physical therapy is less invasive but more visits are required, compared to trigger point injections.  Physical therapy includes electrotherapy, ultrasound diathermy therapy, laser therapy, shock wave therapy and peripheral magnetic stimulation.  Choosing the best modality for each patient depends on the expertise and experience of the doctors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acute treatment, though effective, provide temporary pain relief. For a more sustainable approach, poor posture should be corrected and exercise therapy should be considered. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <ol>
                    <li className='knowledge'>
                        The monitor height should be placed so that the eyes are in a horizontal plane.

                    <li className='knowledge'>
                        The keyboard and mouse should be positioned such that the elbow is in 90 degree flexion.
                    </li>
                    <li className='knowledge'>
                        The wrists should be in a slightly extended position.
                    </li>
                    <li className='knowledge'>
                        The hips should be at a 90-degree angle and the feet placed flat on the floor.
                    </li>
                    <li className='knowledge'>
                        The head, shoulder, and hips should be aligned, with the back supported by the chair.
                    </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office workers are advised to relieve muscle tension every 30 minutes, without interrupting the train of thought by setting an interval-timer and placing it across the room.  Then they must get up and can stretch while they walk to turn off the buzzer and reset the timer.
                </p>

                <h4> Exercise therapy </h4> 

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercise is the most important therapy.  Multiple modalities of exercise should be considered, including:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretching exercises:  Stretching is one of the most important steps.  Any method that can gently stretch and lengthen a muscle can be considered, including self-stretching using the Anderson technique, or therapist-assisted methods such as Travell and Simons technique, or Janda technique.  Yoga is also considered an alternative effective self-stretching exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength exercises:  Strengthening muscles can reduce the likelihood of them developing trigger points in the future.  Strengthening exercises includes high load, and low repetition of different groups of muscles.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endurance exercise includes aerobic training such as running, swimming or biking, which strengthens both the cardiovascular system and multiple muscle groups.  A regular exercise program minimizes the chance of reactivating trigger points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relaxation exercises such as contract-relax and yoga can help decrease mental stress and relax the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For best therapeutic results, exercise should be done under supervision of doctors and physical therapists.  If done wrongly, exercise can be dangerous.  For example, a rapid, forceful stretching motion could cause pain and muscle spasm; they tend to irritate muscle tissue and worsen trigger points, instead of releasing them.
